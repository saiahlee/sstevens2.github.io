I am a PhD Candidate in the [Microbiology Doctoral Training Program](https://microbiology.wisc.edu/) at [University of Wisconsin - Madison](http://www.wisc.edu/).
I currently work in the [McMahon Lab](https://mcmahonlab.wisc.edu/) studying freshwater microbes in lakes in Wisconsin.
I am focused on using reference genomes (genomes from metagenomes and single-cell genomes) of unculturable but common freshwater bacteria to understanding how the diversity of the related bacterial populations changes through time using a metagenomic time series.
This work is being done in collaboration with the [DOE Joint Genome Institute](http://jgi.doe.gov/).
My research interests, very generally, include Microbial Ecology, Genomics, Environmental Microbiology, Computational Biology/Bioinformatics, and Limnology.

I am very passionate about reproducible research and open science and over the years I have taught many labmates and other graduate students to use unix/command-line and python/R.
This experience helped me discover my own interest in teaching researchers computational skills.
Along that line, I teach [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/)(and [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/)) workshops and started a local study group called [Computation Biology, Ecology, and Evolution (ComBEE) group](https://sites.google.com/a/wisc.edu/combee/). [ComBEE](https://sites.google.com/a/wisc.edu/combee/) provides an opportunity for researchers to discuss new computational tools and learn bioinformatics skills together.
We also host both a python and R study groups on a bi-weekly basis.
