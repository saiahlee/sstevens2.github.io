This as with many of my other posts, was inspired by my [Software Carpentry][swc] instructor training.
Nearly, three years later and so much of what I learn still rattles around my brain and often out my mouth.

## Why is showing people your code super scary?

It is nerve racking to have someone look over your words, either code or written word.
There is something personal about those words we worked so hard to put together or that script we struggled for days to code up.

I've heard it so many times when I each github or in the [ComBEE][combee] study group.

Some variation on "My code sucks so I don't want people to look at it." 
*or* "I'm just not ready for someone to look at this piece of code."

It is very scary to put your code out there.
I personally live in fear of people finding my code on github and then sending me messages about how terrible my code is.

Here is where I could tell you that you _just_ have to get over it but I think that would be ignoring where this fear spawns from.
I think it comes from a similar place as the fear I talked about in [my first post][firstpost].
The internet is not always a safe place for people to share their thoughts.
Aside from trolls, there are also people who don't know how to give *contructive feedback* (a topic I will talk about in a later blog post).
But I think with some work we can make places where people can feel comfortable getting and giving code review.

## The need for code review

### Gaps in knowledge

For a non-beginner, code review can actually be one of the easier ways to get better at programming.
When you are beginner you read a book or go to a class/workshop and much of what you see is new and relevant.
Once you've got some skill with programming you might have to search or sit through a majority of information that you already know, making it harder to find the tidbits you need.
If you are a self-taught programmer like me, you probably learned pieces of code as you needed them.
Being able to find what you need is a good skill to have but it can also mean you miss out on some pieces.
I'll give you a prime example using my past in python.

I never learned [`ennumerate()`][py-ennumerate](which is a way to automatically number the items you are ranging over) when I learned to code in python.
But I could code around it.
So for the longest time that is what I did.
Then I helped teach a workshop and it blew my mind when I discovered this function.
How had I gone so long without it!?!?
But it was one of the only things in the workshop I'd never seen before.

If I'd had someone else look over my code, they could have told me about this much sooner.
Code review can fill in the gaps of knowledge and improve the code we are producing.

### Mistakes

There is also the times when we make mistakes.
We are human, it happens.
But if we keep our code to ourselves because it is "too ugly", then we might be using scripts with errors in them and, worse case, publishing results based on flawed code.
Since I've learned more about code review, it is scary for me to think about the possibility that there are errors in my own published code and analyses.


## Possible Solutions

So I've come to the conclusion that I really need code review but how do I get it?
And how do I get this feedback regularly? From people I trust?

A couple models I can think of include...

Lab Meeting
: Regular meetings where people take turns sharing their code and giving feedback
- Pros: Meets regularly
- Cons: Might not have experts, have to moderate group/have a code of conduct
Study Group
: Like Lab meeting but with a more diverse set of people
Buddy System
: Share code with a friend/co-worker and review code
- Pros: Can get feedback when you need it, friendly form of feedback
- Cons: The other person might miss things or not know enough to be helpful

## What I imagine and will attempt to put together
Virtual Study Group
: Group of people who agree to a code of conduct (w/moderator), list of known proficiencies or shared language requirements, people share code on github that they want feedback on, others volunteer to look at this code, rules for asking for formatting improvements/comments???
