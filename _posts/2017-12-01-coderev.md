This as with many of my other posts, was inspired by my [Software Carpentry][swc] instructor training.
Nearly, three years later and so much of what I learn still rattles around my brain and often out my mouth.

## Why it is super scary

It is nerve racking to have someone look over your words, either code or written word.
There is something personal about those words we worked so hard to put together or that script we struggled for days to code up.

I've heard it so many times when I each github or in the ComBEE study group.

Some variation on "My code sucks so I don't want people to look at it." 
*or* "I'm just not ready for someone to look at this piece of code."

It is very scary to put your code out there.
I personally live in fear of people finding my code on github and then sending me messages about how terrible my code is.

Here is where I could tell you to just get over it but I think that would be ignoring where this fear spawns from.
I think it comes from a similar place as the fear I talked about in [my first post][firstpost].
The internet is not always a safe place for people to share their thoughts.
Aside from trolls, there are also people who just don't know how to give *contructive feedback* (a topic I will talk about in a later blog post).
But I think with some work we can make places for people to feel comfortable getting and give code review.

## The need for code review

If you are a self-taught programmer, you probably learned to code as you needed it.
Being able to pick it up is a good skill to have but it can also mean you miss out on some of the pieces that could make it easier for you.
I'll give you a prime example using my past that will probably only be meaningful for python coders.

I never learned `ennumerate()` when I learned to code in python.
But I could code around it 
<!-- Flesh this out for non python programmers-->
