title: Community Building - Starting A Study Group

To start with, **many thanks** to all the people who posted encouraging comments on my [first post](firstpost).
I really appreciated all the support and shared experiences.

## The need for study groups

Turns out, many(most?) biologists need computation but most of us aren't trained in doing computation.
While reserachers are very excited about the large amounts of sequencing data that can be generated, we still lack training around using the computational tools need to analyze such data.
One of my most common rants is the lack of computational course requirements for undergraduate biology majors but I'll just leave that right here right now.
While I think that [Software Carpentry](swc) and [Data Carpentry](dc) workshops are tremendously helpful, researchers need longer term support.
And along comes study groups.
One of the things I love about the study group model is that your study group can be whatever the community needs.

## A brief history of ComBEE

I came to graduate school with a little bit of computational skills from my informatics minor and year as a lab tech doing genome assembly.
I'd struggled to learn a lot of computation on my own in my year as a tech and then I saw other students from both my lab and program with little or no training struggle to learn coding.
I hated that we all 'had' to struggle through it alone.
So at in the fall of 2014, based on an idea from my advisor, I decided to start my own study group around Computational Biology, Ecology and Evolution, [ComBEE](combee).
My group would meet once a month and talk about metagenomics, 16S amplicon sequencing, making phylogenetic trees.
Since none of my labmates at the time used Python, I also was desperate for people to talk Python with.
So under the [ComBEE](combee) group I started a [Python Study Group](psg), which would meet every other week.
In 2015 at a [ComBEE](combee) social someone (or several someones) asked that I start an [R Study Group](rsg), that that started to meet on the weeks [Python Study Group](psg)].

Over the years [ComBEE](combee) has changed a bit.
We had a not-so-great name to start with (more about that below).
My original co-chair became busy and eventually I found someone else to replace him, with his permission of course.
This year I found someone to replace me and she made our website much prettier.
But the group still meets at the same intervals and the most important things haven't changed: people learn something, support each other's learning, and have long term support for developing their coding skills.

## What I've learned

1. Don't do it alone!
Mozilla!!!
2. Pick a good name
While this is slightly funny it has actually been a tripping point for our group. MomIEE story and recruiting people outside micro.
3. Advertise
4. Delegate!!!

----------------------------

In this post I'll talk about my experiences starting a study group called Computational Biology Ecology, and Evolution, [ComBEE](combee) for short.
It will also serve as an unofficial history now that I've handed off the running of this group.
I originally envisioned telling the [ComBEE](combee) history first but it was long so I switched it around so you can skip my verbose history.

## What I've Learned



## A History of ComBEE
In my 3rd year of graduate school I sat down with my advisor for my annual review.
'Annual review' sounds rather formal but this meeting is to check that I'm on track and getting what I need from my advisor. 
Among other wonderful professional development suggestions (such as becoming a [Software Carpentry](swc) instructor) she suggested I start a group to bring together the grad students at our university that use similar computational tools to answer microbial ecology questions.
There are a number of labs at UW-Madison which study microbial ecology questions and we were all struggling to learn the computational skills needed separately.
The connections between labs depended on the informal friendship network of students in the same program, being in the same building, or PI connections.
This system had several flaws:
1. Not everyone studying microbial ecology had students from the same grad program
2. Not all of these labs are in the same building
3. The PI network is not perfect

She put me in touch with another grad student who was interested in start up a group like this and we were off!
Our first meeting was getting ideas for other meetings and putting together an email listserv.
From there is was mostly putting together ideas, making a schedule, and sending reminder emails.

Along with our monthly meetings, I really wanted to start a Python study group.
I'd seen advertisements for such a group when I interned at the [DOE's Joint Genome Institute](jgi) and since no one in my lab used Python at the time, I was desparate for a group of people to talk with about Python.
*So I started one.*
[Python study group](psg) has always been really informal.
We make a list of topics, usually modules/libraries/packages, to talk about at the beginning of the semester, and then each week we talk about one of them.
Sometimes this means we do code review and get to learn from each other's code.
Sometimes no one knows anything about the topic and we read documentation together and figure out how a package is useful.
Even in weeks I didn't feel like I learned something, it was nice to have a group of people to talk to about my Python struggles and successes.

The following year at our social gathering, I got some feedback that people wanted an R study group.
*So I started one.*
[R study group](rsg) has gone pretty similarly to python study group.

Somewhere along the way, my co-chair became super busy with other stuff and I was feeling overwhelmed.
With my previous co-chair's permission, I took on a new co-chair.
This last year I decided that I didn't want to leave [ComBEE](combee) high and dry when I *fingers crossed* graduate.
So I found my replacement and overlapped with her for a semester.
Now [ComBEE](combee) runs without me.
While that was a bit bittersweet, the new co-chairs are doing an amazing job!
Many of those little things I wanted to do and never got to, like improving the website, they've done!
It is wonderful to have some fresh eyes.
I'm weirdly proud of [ComBEE](combee) now that I'm not running it.
