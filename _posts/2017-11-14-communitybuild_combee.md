title: Community Building - Starting A Study Group

To start with, **many thanks** to all the people who posted encouraging comments on my [first post](firstpost).
I really appreciated all the support and shared experiences.

## The need for study groups

Turns out, many(most?) biologists need computation but most of us aren't trained in doing computation.
While reserachers are very excited about the large amounts of sequencing data that can be generated, we still lack training around using the computational tools need to analyze such data.
One of my most common rants is the lack of computational course requirements for undergraduate biology majors but I'll just leave that right here right now.
While I think that [Software Carpentry](swc) and [Data Carpentry](dc) workshops are tremendously helpful, researchers need longer term support.
And along comes study groups.
One of the things I love about the study group model is that your study group can be whatever the community needs.

## A brief history of ComBEE

I came to graduate school with a little bit of computational skills from my informatics minor and year as a lab tech doing genome assembly.
I'd struggled to learn a lot of computation on my own in my year as a tech and then I saw other students from both my lab and program with little or no training struggle to learn coding.
I hated that we all 'had' to struggle through it alone.
So at in the fall of 2014, based on an idea from my advisor, I decided to start my own study group around Computational Biology, Ecology and Evolution, [ComBEE](combee).
My group would meet once a month and talk about metagenomics, 16S amplicon sequencing, making phylogenetic trees.
Since none of my labmates at the time used Python, I also was desperate for people to talk Python with.
So under the [ComBEE](combee) group I started a [Python Study Group](psg), which would meet every other week.
In 2015 at a [ComBEE](combee) social someone (or several someones) asked that I start an [R Study Group](rsg), that that started to meet on the weeks [Python Study Group](psg)].

Over the years [ComBEE](combee) has changed a bit.
We had a not-so-great name to start with (more about that below).
My original co-chair became busy and eventually I found someone else to replace him, with his permission of course.
This year I found someone to replace me and she made our website much prettier.
But the group still meets at the same intervals and the most important things haven't changed: people learn something, support each other's learning, and have long term support for developing their coding skills.

## What I've learned

1. Don't do it alone!
Mozilla!!!
2. Pick a good name
While this is slightly funny it has actually been a tripping point for our group. MomIEE story and recruiting people outside micro.
3. Advertise
4. Delegate!!!
Both for leadership and for getting people involved and keeping them.
