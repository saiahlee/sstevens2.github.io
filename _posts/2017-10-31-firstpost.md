title: Why I'm terrified of blogging - My First Blog Post
author: Sarah Stevens

I've gone back and forth a lot about starting a blog but have finally decided to give it a try.

There are so many reasons to have a blog:
- Lots of cool open science people have blogs. 
- Good practice writing and putting my thoughts together. 
- A place to share my ideas and thoughts. 
- _Hopefully_ find/build community and help others 

### So what has held me back?  Why didn't I do this sooner?

Well the internet is often a harsh place and I've found that out the hard way.
I was in high schools when blogs rose to popularity and high schoolers can be *mean*.

Even in grad school I've had demotivating experiences (which I won't go into) that increased my anxiety about asking questions and putting my words on the internet.
It is really hard to learn new computational skills when you are afraid of posting questions to the 

Not to mention the trollery and cruelty I've seen on Twitter.
I spend on average probably 15 min contemplating each tweet because it makes me so nervous.

### Why now?

A couple of factors have come together to motivate me to start this blog.

In the past few years, I've become a part of some awesome open science communities - [Software Carpentry](swc)/[Data Carpentry](dc) and [Mozilla Science Lab](mozilla).

I've learned a lot about how to give and [get feedback](swc-feedback) and [creating a positive learning environment](swc-environment) when I learned to be a [Software Carpentry](swc) intructor.
I started my own [study group](mozilla-sg), [ComBEE](combee), to help create such an environment for biologists (_but you don't have to be a biologist to come to our events_ :wink:) on my campus who want to learn computational skills.  When you put it all together, It is important to me that others don't bad experiences and become demotivated trying to learn computation/bioinformatics.
I'm hoping through this blog I can share my experiences and help others create a more positive learning atmosphere.

However the final push to start a blog came from a great talk I attended by [Liz Neeley](https://www.storycollider.org/team-bios/liz-neeley) and [Ed Yong](https://www.theatlantic.com/author/ed-yong/) about telling your story.

(Sorry for the grainy picture where you can't see the speakers. I was really far back in the room.)

This talk got me thinking again and led to me writing up notes for this post and making lists of blog post ideas.  And here we are!

### Let's get started!

Well here is my first post but I'm going to make a goal and state it here to keep me accountable.

> I **will** post a blog post every two weeks until I  run out of topics on my list (which should last us about 3 months if I don't think of any new ones).

#### How you can help?

Post some encouragement!  While this is obviously a cheap trick for comments :wink:, I'd love to hear from you.  I will moderate any haters/trolls though.
